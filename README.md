# Sudoku
This is  the sudoku project that i have built. It automatically createsa new Sudoku at startup and can alsso create 
a new one on demand with given numbers ranging from 17-40(17 is the lowest number a sudoku has a single solution and
40 is the maximum number that my algorithm can process in less than 2 seconds) I will try to improve the code efficiency
and also add more threads(currently 2) in order to increase the upper limit of numbers. Feel free to try the projects and
if you encounter any bug feel free to contact me in order to fix it
